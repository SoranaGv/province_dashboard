# province_dashboard
This repository contains the source code for an interactive, web-based dashboard developed to explore parcel-level CO₂ emissions under different water management scenarios. The dashboard is built with Plotly Dash (Python) and enables users to interactively select parcels, apply water-level scenarios, and view dynamically updated emission totals.
